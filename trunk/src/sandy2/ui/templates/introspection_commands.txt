The commands available are:

% for ds in M.doc_strings:
      ${ds}
% endfor

We try to add to these all the time, so check back regularly.

<%def name="text__inspect_microparsers_command()">${inspect_command_header()}

The filters are evaluated in the following order:
% for filter_name in M.parser_filters:
  ${filter_name}
% endfor

The actions are evaluated after the filters, in the follwing order: 
% for action_name in M.parser_actions:
  ${action_name}  
% endfor 

These are contributed by plugins. The following plugins are installed:
% for plugin in System.plugin_framework.plugins:
  ${plugin.id}
% endfor

<%def name="inspect_command_header()">The system is constructed of a number of systems. Two of them are:

<%def name="text__metadata_command()">
The contents of the metadata data structure is as follows:
% for k, v in M.items():
	${k} : ${v}
% endfor

It should be noted that this will change depending on what command is run, and where it is run from.

I also have access to System data which for obvious reasons, I will not enumerate here. Some of which may be useful, and can be referred to as:
% for k in System.keys():
    ${k}
% endfor
