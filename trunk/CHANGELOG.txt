Commit adds functionality for use of an email transport. Specifically, gmail (TLS hardcoded).
Also change of database to MySQL
Also change of database abstraction to use a more linq like module. This is no doubt completely re-inventing the python wheel, though I still feel ORM is overkill.

Initial commit in trunk. Console based parser, date parsing, scheduled messages. Plugin based, though not eggs.
