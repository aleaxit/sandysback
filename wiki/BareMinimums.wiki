= Feature List for first prototype =
_These are things without which it's pointless to consider it a working prototype_

 * Parsing written English into calendar events (issue 1)
     (including disambiguating dates using European/American standards)
 * Tagging (and smart tagging at that - @weekly, @monthly) (issue 2)
 * Email reminders (on queue and daily digests) (issue 3)
 * Reschedule/edit appointments and to-dos (issue 4)
 * Recurring events (issue 5)



= Production (beta) Version = 
_These things are really nice but not killers for an alpha release_
 * Twitter/laconi.ca/identi.ca (issue 6) or just plain SMS support (issue 7) _I'd prefer this in the alpha but can understand if it needs to wait to beta. Anna_
 * Info attached to an event maybe just textbox to write unformated text in? step up to simplified wiki markup à lá googlecode?) (issue 8)
 * Add events via XMPP messaging (ie. jabber, google talk, etc) (issue 9)
 * Export to .ics (goodness for google calendar, ical, and all things compliant with RFC 2445) (issue 10)


= Future Versions =
 * Multiple "personalities"(not just Sandy) (issue 11)
 * Sending reminders to "friends" (issue 12)
