= Introduction =

I'm not a programmer by any means, but I had to map out the logic for e-mails that the service sends in order to come up with phrase databases...so I thought I'd write it out for you all.

Hope it helps

---- 
= Remind/Remember/R Email Response =
==Section 1: GREETING==
This is how the Remind email response is mapped out

===SIMPLE PROTOTYPE VERSION:===
|GREETING| (i.e. Good Morning, NAME!)

===EXPANDED VERSION (EVENTUALLY):===
CHECK WHAT TIME IT IS 
If it’s from 5AM to 7:30AM
|EARLY| (i.e. Wow, NAME, you’re up early!”
If it’s from 7:30AM to 12PM
|MORNING|
If it’s from 12PM to 6:00PM
|G3: AFTERNOON|
If it’s from 6PM to 11PM
|EVENING|
If it’s from 11PM to 5AM
|LATE|

==Section 2: Output Items Requested To Remember==
===Priority 1: Calendar Items===
SEE IF THERE’S A DATE IN THE REQUEST
IF SCHEDULED FOR ONE DATE (@CAL or whatever in backend, not time-specific): 
|CAL1A| (i.e. I scheduled this for you:)
OUTPUT ITEM

NOTE: If it’s one day with no time and just date, output this after:
|CAL1B| (i.e. I didn't see a time for this reminder, so I scheduled it for 12am. To set a time now, reply with: update #1 |OR 2+} |when to remind you|. For example: update #1 |OR 2+| 11/14/2008 at 2pm.)

Make sure it spits out the todo number as the number referred to in "update #X"

IF SCHEDULED FOR TWO OR MORE DATES (@CAL or whatever in backend, not time-specific): 
|CAL2A| (i.e. I scheduled these for you:)
OUTPUT ITEMS

For each one that's listed that doesn't have a date, put this below it:
|CAL1B| (i.e. I didn't see a time for this reminder, so I scheduled it for 12am. To set a time now, reply with: update #1 |OR 2+} |when to remind you|. For example: update #1 |OR 2+| 11/14/2008 at 2pm.)

Make sure it spits out the todo number as the number referred to in "update #X"

===Priority 2: To-do Items===
AFTER CALENDAR ITEM OUTPUT, THE NEXT PRIORITY IS A TODO
IF TAG IS @TODO, IS ONE ITEM:
|TODO1A| (i.e. I scheduled this and added it to your to-do list:)
OUTPUT ITEM

Then output this:
|TODO1B"I didn't see a date or time for this reminder, so I scheduled for it to be done as soon as possible. To set a date or time now, reply with: update #1 |when to remind you|. For example: update #1 11/14/2008 at 2pm.)

IF TAG IS @TODO, IS TWO OR MORE ITEMS:
|TODO2A| (i.e. I scheduled these and added them to your to-do list:)
OUTPUT ITEMS LINE BY LINE, SO THEY CAN BE UPDATED/REFERRED TO 

Then output this after each:
|TODO2B| (i.e. I didn't see a date or time for this reminder, so I scheduled for it to be done as soon as possible.  To set a date or time now, reply with: update #1 |OR 2+} |when to remind you|. For example: update #1 |OR 2+| 11/14/2008 at 2pm.)

Make sure it spits out the todo number as the number referred to in "update #X"

===Priority 3: Else Items===
Finally, it’ll just be what’s tagged otherwise to remember
IF TAG IS ELSE AND IS ONE ITEM: 
|TAG1A| (i.e. I’ve taken note of this:)
OUTPUT ITEM

Then output this:
|TAG1B| (i.e. To make this note a todo or to assign any date to it, reply with: update #1 |when to remind you|. For example: update #1 11/14/2008 at 2pm.)

IF TAG IS ELSE AND IS TWO OR MORE ITEMs:
|TAG2A| (i.e. I’ve taken note of these:)
OUTPUT ITEMS

Then output this after each:
|TAG1B| (i.e. To make this note a todo or to assign any date to it, reply with: update #1 |when to remind you|. For example: update #1 11/14/2008 at 2pm.)
